#How to create a slack workflow:
  Inside of slack under the org name, there is a tool section that includes a workflow builder we will be using to create this.
  ![alt text](https://github.com/liatrio/github-workflows/blob/cve-notification-workflow/.github/workflows/docs/workflow-builder-location.png?raw=true)

    Once you are within the workflow builder page, you should create a new one with a webhook as the starting point.
    Add variables based on what will be sent to the workflow through that webhook.
    Add a step to send a message and inside that step you can configure that message to include the variables you defined in the previous step.
    Once you publish your slack workflow, you will be given a URL for your webhook to be able to communicate with.
