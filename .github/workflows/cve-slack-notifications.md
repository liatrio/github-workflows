# How to create a slack workflow:
  Inside of slack under the org name, there is a tool section that includes a workflow builder we will be using to create this.

    1. Once you are within the workflow builder page, you should create a new one with a webhook as the starting point.
    2. Add the same variables that we are using inside the github workflow.

    3. Add a step to send a message and inside that step you can configure that message to include the variables you 
      defined in the previous step.

    4. Once you publish your slack workflow, you will be given a URL for your webhook to be able to communicate with.
